## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- First time with SCSS

### What I learned

SCSS - wow this can be really useful tool, especially when you suddenly switch from vanilla CSS.
GRID - this was simpler than I expect. Maybe because I've made simple structure but still I understand GRID and this is important.

### Continued development

MORE SCSS LEARNING!!
I want to focus on creating landing pages, simple web stores and card websitess
